*Welcome to Clay!*

Clay is composed of sections of text and units of code. It is completely
defined by a single HTML file and depends on nothing else.

At any point, you can save the document using the Save button at the top right
and upon loading the resulting file in a separate window, you can continue
writing and coding as if nothing happened.

However, /there is no auto save yet!/ Clay does not use localStorage at this
point in time.

*How to Use Clay*

In a /section of text/, you have access to these simple styles:

Plain
*Bold*
/Italics/
_Underline_
-Strikethrough-

In a /unit of code/, you can execute arbitrary Javascript and see either the
result or the error. Your code is run in a transient web worker's context,
meaning the state of the sandbox that is running your code is flushed every
time you hit Return.

You can add sections of text, add units of code, remove any unit or section,
save the whole document, and reset the document. Also, the icons to the top
right of any unit or section provide an anchor link to that section or unit.

Also, you can easily extend Clay by opening the HTML file you in any text
editor.
